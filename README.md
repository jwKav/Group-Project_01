# Group Project - Engineering 52
A small group project done by the class to create N-Unit tests and take in RAW SQL queries to run against a database.

## Getting Started
To run the tests, clone the project and install a copy of the northwind database found here https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs

### Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017+


### Installing & Running
Once cloned and put into Visual Studios, Run the tests by pressing Ctrl + R,A or open the Test toolbar and *Run Tests*

### What we tested
We built 20 tests with multiple testcases *(33)* for each method

### How we built it
We were a group of 7, split into 3 teams. We split up the work into sprints based off of __User Stories__ for each test needed to be built. Team 1 would handle all tests and code that involved the "Order" class, Team 2 would handle the "Products" class and 3 would be handling the "Customer" class.

### Built With
Visual Studio 2019 - Code 
Github - Version Control System
